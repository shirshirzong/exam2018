What is the most interesting/funny/cool thing(s) about Python that you learned from this class or from somewhere else.

You can use code or a short paragraph to illustrate it.

#I think the coolest thing about Python that I have learned from this class, is how fast the algorithms can run through thousands of data and find the useful ones that we need. 
#For example for question two, there were so much data stored in the library, while using python we can find the highest proportion for certain baby names in couple seconds.
#as long as the algorithm runs, no matter how huge the data is, we will be able to analyze it.
